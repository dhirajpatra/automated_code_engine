**\# Ollama: A Microservices Code Generation Engine Powered by OpenAI**

Ollama is a powerful application that leverages OpenAI's capabilities to automate microservices code generation, streamlining your development process. It seamlessly transforms front-end code (Dart) or API descriptions (Swagger) into complete back-end infrastructure, comprising:

  - **FastAPI Scripts:** Ollama generates robust FastAPI scripts tailored to your specific API requirements.
  - **Model Creation:** Data models are automatically generated based on the extracted information, ensuring data integrity and consistency.
  - **Database Setup:** Ollama empowers you to choose the appropriate database technology (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL) and configures it for your microservices.
  - **Microservices Architecture:** Ollama fosters the creation of well-structured microservices with clearly defined interfaces and communication channels. This promotes modularity, scalability, and maintainability.

**Key Features:**

  - **Flexibility:** Ollama accommodates both Dart front-end code and Swagger files, providing wider applicability.
  - **Automation:** Ollama streamlines microservices development by automating code generation and setup, saving you valuable time and effort.
  - **Efficiency:** Ollama helps you focus on business logic and core features, reducing boilerplate code creation.
  - **Integration:** Ollama seamlessly integrates with OpenAI, harnessing the power of state-of-the-art AI to generate efficient code.

**Prerequisites:**

  - **Docker:** Ensures containerized execution for a consistent environment ([https://www.docker.com/](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&source=gmail&q=https://www.docker.com/)).
  - **Docker Compose:** Simplifies multi-container application management ([https://docs.docker.com/compose/](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)).
  - **Python 3.x:** Provides the necessary language runtime ([https://www.python.org/](https://www.python.org/)).
  - **OpenAI API Key:** Obtain your key from [https://beta.openai.com/account/api-keys](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&source=gmail&q=https://beta.openai.com/account/api-keys).

**Installation:**

1.  **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/ollama.git
    cd ollama
    ```

2.  **Create a `.env` File:**

    In the project root, create a `.env` file to store sensitive information like OpenAI API key and database credentials. Refer to `.env.example` for guidance (if provided).

    ```
    OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
    DATABASE_URL=your_database_url
    # ... other environment variables (if needed)
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Run the Application:**

      - Open a terminal in the project directory.

      - Start the application using:

        ```bash
        docker-compose up --build
        ```

      - Alternatively, for development with auto-reloading:

        ```bash
        docker-compose up --build -d --service-ports  # Start in detached mode
        docker-compose exec server sh -c "python manage.py runserver" # Run server within container
        ```

5.  **Access the Application (Optional):**

    If a front-end component exists, access the application at `http://localhost:<port>`, where `<port>` is typically `8000` (adjust if configured differently).

**Usage (API Reference - Placeholder):**

  - **GET /health:** Returns a simple health check response.
  - **POST /generate-backend:** Accepts code or API descriptions (details on format will be added later in the documentation). Responds with the generated microservices code or an error message.

**Testing (Placeholder):**

  - Refer to the `tests` folder (if provided) for unit and/or integration tests.
  - Instructions on running tests will be added upon implementation.
